%% The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^(2) + 2^(2) + ... + 10^(2) = 385
%% The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^(2) = 55^(2) = 3025
%% Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
%% Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

answer() ->
    Nums = lists:seq(1, 100),
    SqSum = round(math:pow(lists:sum(Nums), 2)),
    SumSq = lists:sum(lists:map(fun(X) -> X*X end, Nums)),
    SqSum - SumSq.
