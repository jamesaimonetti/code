* Cycliq Video Processor

Cycliq Fly12 and Fly6 video cameras record in 5- or 10-minute chunks. This tool stitches those clips together into rides.

From there, we can re-encode for YouTube uploads, do Picture-in-picture of the front/rear video, and more!

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./stitch_rides.escript [fly12 | fly6]
#+END_SRC

Assumes the memory card is mounted to =/mnt= and videos are in directories under =/mnt/DCIM=. Will pull clips into =priv/clips= and concat them into one video file in =priv/rides=.

** Concat videos

Using https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Concatenate#protocol

1. Create .ts versions of the clips
2. Concat .ts versions into single video file

** Encoding for Youtube:
