%% The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999,
%% and is a Mersenne prime of the form 2^(6972593)âˆ’1; it contains exactly 2,098,960 digits.
%% Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form 2^(p)âˆ’1, have been found which contain more digits.
%% However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains 2,357,207 digits: 28433Ã—2^(7830457)+1.
%% Find the last ten digits of this prime number.
