%% It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
%% diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying
%% along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
%% If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral
%% with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the
%% side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both
%% diagonals first falls below 10%?

%% from forum, the four corners are N*N, N*N-N+1, N*N -2N+2, N*N-3N+3, which reduces to 4*N*N - 6*N + 6, for N > 1
